# Filebrowser action for neuro-flow

This is a [`neuro-flow`](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow) action launching [Filebrowser](https://hub.docker.com/r/filebrowser/filebrowser) app for working with platform storage.

All it needs is a reference to a storage folder that becomes root folder for filebrowser instance.
